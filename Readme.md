## TYPO3 extension di_examples

A small showcase extension to show the new possibilities regarding dependency
injection in TYPO3 10. It goes alongside the blog post [Dependency Injection in TYPO3](https://usetypo3.com/posts/dependency-injection.html)

### Requirements

TYPO3 10.0 or higher.

### Installation

Install the extension in your TYPO3 system and add the plugin to a page of your choice.
No further configuration is required. 

### What it does

The extension provides a backend module as well as a frontend plugin. Both serve the
mere purpose to demonstrate what dependency injection strategies are available
when using the new system-wide dependency injection integrated in TYPO3 10.0.
